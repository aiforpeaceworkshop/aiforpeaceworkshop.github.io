We invite submissions for presentations at our workshop under two tracks:

- **Tiny papers track** presenting novel work or work in progress relevant to the topics of interest listed below. This track welcomes concise contributions that may not fit the scope of full conference papers but still offer valuable insights to the community. Submissions may be up to 2 pages (excluding references and supplementary material). All accepted tiny papers will be shared via OpenReview and presented as posters during the workshop, with a select few invited for short oral presentations.

- **Previously published work** related to the workshop topics of interest listed below. These submissions will be evaluated solely for eligibility and relevance. Accepted works will be presented as posters, with exceptional submissions considered for spotlight presentations.

While AI assistance is permitted, AI-generated papers are not allowed. Papers should follow the [Policies on Large Language Model Usage at ICLR 2026](https://blog.iclr.cc/2025/08/26/policies-on-large-language-model-usage-at-iclr-2026/), including the disclosure of LLM usage.

The reviewing process will be single-blind and managed through OpenReview. During submission, authors will be required to disclose all sources of funding related to the research. We welcome submissions that fall under one of the following topics:

- Studies investigating how basic research transitions into military applications.
- Effects of AI militarization on marginalized communities and global inequalities.
- Research efforts that contribute directly to peace-building applications in a non-violent way.
- Collective strategies to address ethical risks as a community.
- Historical or comparative analyses of dual-use technology governance.
- Sociotechnical audits of existing military AI systems.
- Whistleblowing mechanisms and academic responsibility in high-risk research.

### Presentation format

We anticipate receiving approximately 20 submissions and plan to accept about 10–15 contributions. All accepted tiny papers will be presented at least as poster presentations and given the option to be featured on the workshop website. Given the sensitive nature of the topic, authors will also have the option to publish their work anonymously, if desired.

### Managing conflicts of interest

We will follow the standard conflict of interest (COI) protocol commonly used in academic workshops. Both authors and reviewers will be asked to declare any conflicting email domains, which will be used to guide reviewer assignments and ensure a fair evaluation process. Additionally, organizers will recuse themselves from any final discussions involving papers with which they have a conflict of interest, including submissions from someone within the same organization.
